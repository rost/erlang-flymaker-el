* erlang-flymaker-el

These are a couple of functions intended for use together with
/erlang-flymake.el/ bundled with OTP.

I wanted to be able to run the erlang compiler directly from elisp
code instead of keeping track of external Erlang code. Turned out such
code had found it's way into mainline OTP. The functionality in
/erlang-flymaker-el/ seemed to be missing though.
